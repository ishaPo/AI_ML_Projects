# AI_ML_Projects

This repo will contain small AI, ML, Deep Learning projects that I have done and so on- mostly ML related code snippets/mini-projects.




**Project 1: Deep Learning Project**

File Name: 'Deep_Learning_Cancer_Detection'

This is a mini Project using a basic CNN Network to train a model for binary classification (Cancer or No- Cancer) of a set of image data set obtained from Kaggle using Keras library in Python.


**Project 2: Simple Question Answering Code using Hugging Face Transformers**

File Name: 'Q_A_Hugging_Face'

This is a basic code where you can ask simple questions to a small dataset and the model will parse the data (such as a csv file) and produce the appropraite answer. Here I have used the 'Sustainable Development Data up to 2023' and taken a subset of the entire data to display how the method works. We can use batching or choice of another model that can accomodate larger datasets in future versions.
