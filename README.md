# AI_ML_Projects

This repo will contain small AI, ML, Deep Learning projects that I have done and so on- mostly ML related code snippets/mini-projects.




**Project 1: Deep Learning Project**
This is a mini Project using a basic CNN Network to train a model for binary classification (Cancer or No- Cancer) of a set of image data set obtained from Kaggle using Keras library in Python.
